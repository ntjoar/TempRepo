## About
BookStack is a textbook exchange application built for students by students. We understand the financial struggle of purchasing expensive textbooks year after year only to sell them back to the school for a greatly reduced price. This is where BookStack comes in to play. Rather than unloading your book back to the school for pennies on the dollar why not throw it on the stack for another student to buy from you. You can make a listing for your book and set an asking price then negotiate with other students. You're almost guaranteed to make more money when selling the book and save money when buying books off the stack from other students.

BookStack runs for specific schools so all the books on the stack were put there by other students at your school. This means you can meet up directly to obtain the book so no extra fees for shipping and handling and you can guarantee the book is what you want and the quality you want it at before ever spending a dollar. You've got nothing to lose, so why not try putting your old textbooks on the stack?
